//programming language is used by the users to interact with the computer or system which only understands binary 
//compiler converts the high level programming language into binary so that the computer can execute the instructions.
//since the computer cannot understand the programming language directly the compuler works as an interface which helps to solve the problem 
//IDE Helps you in writing the code faster and more efficiently and also run the code more faster.
//why should u learn c++ over other languages because of efficency ,strong abstraction capabilities,standard template library,best in resource constrined environment,strong typing and compile time checks
