//variables are the containers which store the values of data which can be changed

//we have different types of data types which defines which type of variable is declared
//when we name a variable it cannot start with special characters it has to be named either with alphanumeric or _ 
//c++ is case senssitve A and a are two different values and have different properties
//to identify the type of input provided by the user we have the data types we ususally define every variable with a data type while writing code
